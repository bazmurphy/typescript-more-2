# Introducing Generics

Generics are a special feature/syntax that allows us to define Re-usable Functions or Classes that can WORK WITH MULTIPLE TYPES

We can write a function that will accept any type and whatever that type is we will return that same type

A generic function says if you give me a number i return a number, if you give me a string i return a string, if you give me a boolean i return a boolean.
