// interface Array<T> and <T> stands for some type
// this is an example of a Generic, you provide some type to it
// and it will return to us an array type of some type in this case number

// So the Interface name is Array and then we must provide a type to it inside the < > Angle brackets
// This is a FACTORY for Array Types.. it is written in a GENERIC way to accept any sort of Type
// and it can return a type based on that
