# Other important compiler options:

`allowJs`

You can then import JavaScript files into your TypeScript

`checkJs`

TypeScript will give you error reporting on JavaScript as well

`sourceMap`

Create source maps for you

`noEmit`

It will not compile files for you, it still does the Type checking

`noEmitOnError`
