// To make something a Two Dimensional Array we have to use double square brackets [][]
// Which is saying I want an Array of Arrays of Strings
const board: string[][] = [
  ["X", "O", "X"],
  ["O", "O", "X"],
  ["X", "O", "O"],
];

// And for a Three Dimensional Array:
const demo: number[][][] = [[[1], [2], [3]]];

// So we first define how many levels of nesting there are and then the type of the nested array
