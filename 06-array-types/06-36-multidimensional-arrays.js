// To make something a Two Dimensional Array we have to use double square brackets [][]
// Which is saying I want an Array of Arrays of Strings
const board = [
    ["X", "O", "X"],
    ["O", "O", "X"],
    ["X", "O", "O"],

// And for a Three Dimensional Array:
const demo = [[[1], [2], [3]]];
// So we first define how many levels of nesting there are and then the type of the nested array
